## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

Write about 1-2 paragraphs describing the purpose of your project.

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things do you need to install the software and how to install them?

```
clone this repository on your local machine to get started
```

### Installing

A step-by-step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running.

if you want to work with the front and backend you should follow these steps

```
cd client
```
``` 
npm install 
```

```
npm run dev
```

then change the directory to the server

```
cd server 
```
``` 
npm install 
```
``` 
npm start
```

once the servers are both started you should go to this URL

```
http://localhost:5173/
```

I tried to make the UI friendly to make it easier to work with

for the post input, any digit to get a limited post

The same goes for the comment input

but for the userId input, any userId from one to 20 to get the post of that user

## üîß Backend Only <a name = "tests"></a>

For those that want to use only the backend here is the documentation

after cloning the repo on your local machine

go to the server directory

```
cd server
```
``` 
npm install 
```

then

```
npm start
```

### Break down into end-to-end tests

Explain what these tests test and why
